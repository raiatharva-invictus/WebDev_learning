      <li>position and order of appearance</li>
      <li>Specificity</li>
      <li>Origin <p>This tells from where the styles have been applied whether by browser(user agent stylesheet) or your own</p></li>
      <li>Importance <p>This overrides the inline order and comes at the topmost priority if applied like you can see in the style tags written by !important</p></li>
